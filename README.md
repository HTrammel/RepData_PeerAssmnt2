# RepData_PeerAssmnt2
Second peer reviewed project for Reproducible Research

This project is about analyzing NOAA data and determining impact of severe weather events on human health 
and the economy.  While there are few guidelines as to what to analyze there are two rather general questions.

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable)
are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic
consequences?

We have to explore the information provided about the data and then develop an approach.

Sounds like fun.
